9. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a sales tax function for the state of Pennsylvania. They would like to be able to take in a annual ammount of money businesses in the state make and deduct the proper amount of taxes from the their earnings. The state of PA should take 7% of a companies earnings.  Thats an Assginment operater
Your function should take in a total sales amount as an argument and return the amount thats owed to the state.  50 persent

Provided is an example of what your program should do:
- If Ian's Development and Design company made $200,000.00, the state should deduct 7% from that total. 
- Ian's Development and Design company should pay $14,000.00 in sales tax. 

9. You have been hired by Apple to help them fix their password system. They would   like you to create A
function that will check how long a password is. Your program should be able to accept an integer password
and also check if the password is more or less than 10 characters long. if the password is longer than 10 characters,
your program should tell the user that their password is too long. If the password is under 4 characters the
function should tell the user the password is too short. If the password meets the length criteria, there should
be a message confirming to the user that their password was created successfully. that would be an function operator

HINT - you will need to use a function that counts the number of characters in a string. I recommend looking this up on W3schools.

   that will inform you on whether you will be admitted into the school based on the schools' reccomendation letter

- Both Mr. Parker and Mr. Kimble have given you a reccomendation letter to Cheyney University.
- Mr. Kimble has given you a letter of reccomendation for Penn State, but Mr. Parker and Mr. Paris have not.
