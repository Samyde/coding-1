// 1.  I Created a function that will accept a word in the
// function parameter

// and return the word in reverse order. For example, the word

// 'pet' should return as 'tep', the word 'book' should return as
//'koob', etc. HINT- There is a built-in function that

// you can use to accomplish this. Please use W3 schools to
// research what function you'll need to use.

  for (i = 0; i < originalStr.length; i++) {
    reversedStr = originalStr.charAt(i) + reversedStr;
  }
  console.log("Reversed string: " + reversedStr);
}

const word = "Banana"
const newWord = word.split("")
const reversedWord= newWord.reverse()
