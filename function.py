# what is a function?
# A function is a set of instructions that will perform a
# specific task.


# there are two variations of functions: usee-defined functions
# and built-in functions

built-in functions: instructions that have already been written,
are built -in  two programs language

print(samyde learns coding') # print is a built-in function. we can idenitfiy functions
by the round brgckets


name=input'('what is your name')
number = int(input('what is your name')
print(name)             
print(3*number)

all data types, variables, and opprators are just places for Us
to use in order to right instructions for functions

User defined- custom functions created by an engineer.

# function definition= tells the computers
# our instructions and stories it for later
